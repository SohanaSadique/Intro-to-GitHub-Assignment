# Intro-to-GitHub-Assignment

*Purpose:* This repository was created as part of the CHEP ML898 Data Wrangling assignment.

*My experience:* Navigating the platform was challenging at the beginning. I had to learn what a repository is, where files are stored, and how GitHub connects with RStudio.  
By working through the assignment step by step, I learned how to make commits, push changes to GitHub, and check my work online. 
Although it felt overwhelming at first but I have enjoyed.
